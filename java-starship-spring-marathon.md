With so many ships now sailing the stars we really need a system to make sure everyone stays safe. Enter the SWA (Space Way Authority). Help the SWA build out some software to make their jobs easier!

## Getting Started

```no-highlight
et get java-starship-spring-marathon
cd java-starship-spring-marathon
idea .
```

The model and service layer have been built for you. We've also provided data in the `JavaStarShipService`. Your job is to build out the controller and the relevant view templates. You will not need to interact with a database.

## Core Requirements

### List StarShips

```no-highlight
As a Space Traffic Controller
I want to see a list of StarShips
So that I can keep the spaceways clear
```

Acceptance Criteria:

- When I navigate to `/starships`, I should see the starships provided courtesy of the `StarShipSessionBasedService`
- For each starship, I should see their name and fuel capacity
- For each starship, there should be a link to view more details about the starship
- For each starship, there should be a link that takes me to `/starships/<starShipId>`

### Show StarShip

```no-highlight
As a Space Traffic Controller
I want to see more detail about an individual starship
So that I can manage its interstellar flight plan
```

Acceptance Criteria:

- When I navigate to `/starships/<starShipId>` I am presented with the relevant starship information
- For the relevant starship, I can see the starship's name, description, and fuel capacity (in Teraliters, stored as an integer)
- There should be a link that takes me back to the index page

### Fuel Capacity Gauge

```no-highlight
As a Space Traffic Controller
I want to have a visual indicator of fuel capacity
So that I can easily ensure all ships can reach their destination
```

Acceptance Criteria:

- When I'm viewing an individual starship, I see a dynamic "fuel capacity" indicator based on the fuel capacity of the ship: "HIGH" (>700), "AVERAGE" (300-700), and "LOW" capacity (<300)
- This capacity should show up under the "Fuel Capacity" section of the show page: e.g. "Fuel Capacity: LOW (295 Teraliters)"

Implementation Details:

- Make sure you conditionally update a _single_ element to implement this feature, rather than having 3 elements that conditionally appear
- First implement this using conditional logic _within_ your Thymeleaf template. Then, consider where you could refactor this out to.

### Add a New StarShip

```no-highlight
As a Space Traffic Controller
I want to add a starship
So that I can keep track of new ships entering the galaxy's spaceways
```

Acceptance Criteria:

- When I navigate to `/starships/new`, I am presented with a form to input a new starship
- I must enter the starship's name, description, and fuel capacity
- Upon successful submission I should be redirected to the "show" page for that starship
- The starship should be persisted in the current Session

### Make it Pretty

```no-highlight
As a Space Traffic Controller
I want my page to be flashy
So I stay alert as I peruse the skies
```

Acceptance Criteria:

- My header on each page should be bright blue
- A starship's description on its show page should be in italics

Implementation Details:

- We have supplied a css file for you in `src/main/resources/static/css/main.css`
- You can access this via a `<link>` in your view templates via the path `/css/main.css`, adding the following inside your `<head>` section: `<link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/main.css">`
